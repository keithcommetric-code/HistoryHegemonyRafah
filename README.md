# HistoryHegemonyRafah
Dataset for a Comparative Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) of 300 news articles on Israel’s 2024 Rafah offensive from UK (BBC, Sky News) and Irish (RTÉ, The Journal) outlets. Quantifies national framing differences across four dimensions, linking discourse patterns to policy divergence.
Comparative Critical Discourse Analysis Data: UK vs. Irish Media Framing of the 2024 Rafah Offensive
This repository contains the coded dataset supporting the study "Media Coverage of Israel’s Assault on Rafah: A Comparative Critical Discourse Analysis of UK and Irish Framing". This quantitative and qualitative dataset was generated using Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) to examine how national historical memory mediates media framing of asymmetric conflicts.
The data empirically demonstrates systematic differences in coverage patterns between media systems operating within comparable democratic frameworks.
1. Project Overview
The dataset covers 300 articles published during Israel's May-July 2024 Rafah operations. The temporal boundaries capture the complete arc of the offensive, enabling analysis of how coverage patterns correlate with subsequent policy developments .
Outlets Included:
• UK Outlets (Traditional Intellectual Functions): BBC (publicly funded national broadcaster) and Sky News (commercial outlet).
• Irish Outlets (Organic Intellectual Positioning): RTÉ (public service broadcaster) and The Journal (independent digital outlet).
The analysis employed axial coding integration with transitivity analysis and Shannon entropy calculations to measure frame diversity and systemic narrative uniformity.
2. Datasets Included
The repository includes four primary coded files, corresponding to the analysis performed on the source material:
File Name	
Outlet/Context	
Total Articles	
Primary Focus
BBC_DATA	
UK Hegemonic Outlet	
Approx. 75 articles (part of 300 sample)	
Demonstrates systematic passive voice for Palestinian casualties (73%) and historical erasure (0% Nakba references).
SKY_DATA	
UK Hegemonic Outlet	
Approx. 75 articles (part of 300 sample)	
Exhibits pronounced asymmetries: 78% active voice attribution to Israeli actions and minimal Palestinian sourcing (10.1% to 15%).
RTE_DATA
Irish Counter-Hegemonic Outlet	
Approx. 75 articles (part of 300 sample)	
Shows inverse patterns: 95.4% active voice attribution for Israeli actions, balanced sourcing (19.0% Palestinian voices), and high use of moral terminology (14.2% "genocide").
TheJournalData	
Irish Counter-Hegemonic Outlet	
Approx. 75 articles (part of 300 sample)	
Achieved greater source diversity (28.5% Palestinian voices) and the highest entropy score (H=1.52), indicating pluralistic framing and systematic historical analogy deployment.
3. Core Coded Variables (CDA Protocol)
The analysis was conducted across four systematic analytical dimensions:
Variable Name	
Analytical Dimension	
Operational Definition	
Key Coding Determinations
Transitivity Determination	
Agency Attribution	
Examines grammatical structures (active/passive voice) to assign responsibility for violence, operationalizing Gramsci's distinction between organic and traditional intellectuals .	
Active (Israeli Agency) vs. Passive (Palestinian Casualty/Condition) .
Lexicalization Determination	
Terminology/Moral Framing	
Tracks strategic word choices to reveal positioning within hegemonic or counter-hegemonic discourse, quantifying explicit legal and moral framings (e.g., "genocide," "massacre") versus euphemistic alternatives (e.g., "precision strikes," "tragic mishap") .	
Legitimizing/Euphemistic vs. Humanitarian/Moral .
Source Selection Determination	
Voice Representation	
Calculates proportional representation of Palestinian, Israeli, and international voices, showing systematic bias toward institutional authority (UK) or pluralistic balance (Ireland) .	
Institutional (Israeli/Western) vs. Palestinian/Local .
Historical Analogy Determination	
Memory Deployment	
Identifies explicit and implicit references to past events (Nakba, colonialism, partition) to examine how collective memory deployment enables hegemonic legitimation or counter-hegemonic critique .	
Activation (e.g., Nakba, Apartheid frame) vs. Historical Erasure .
4. Empirical Highlights
The data provides quantifiable validation of theoretical claims, establishing robust national differences (p < 0.001) :
• Hegemonic Uniformity (UK): BBC and Sky News demonstrated remarkably low entropy scores (H < 0.5), indicating systematic narrative uniformity and the exclusion of alternative interpretive frameworks.
• Active Accountability (Ireland): Irish outlets employed active voice constructions for Israeli actions in 80% to 95.4% of articles, systematically foregrounding Israeli agency and responsibility.
• Historical Erasure: References to the 1948 Nakba appeared zero times in BBC coverage , confirming the UK's ahistorical framing that treats the conflict as a discrete security issue .
• Policy Correlation: The correlation between Irish media framing and policy positioning (e.g., RTÉ’s famine discourse preceding Ireland’s ICJ intervention) suggests the media functioned as legitimatory scaffolding for state action .
